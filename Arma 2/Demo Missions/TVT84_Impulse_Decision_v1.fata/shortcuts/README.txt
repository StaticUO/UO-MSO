	The Editor Folder:
	
	This folder is for all files, functions, or external code called from the editor.
	It's purpose is to make file paths in the editor shorter.
	
	Do not use this folder to contain entire components; instead use it to 'link' to
	the respective module. This is a good coding standard.
	
	Thank you,
