<br/>1. Background
<br/>
<br/>The local Al-Qaeda forces recently disabled a low-flying US Army Blackhawk and took the pilots (us) captive. The local Al-Qaeda, though, have been looking to leave the once prosperous land of FATA but lack the necessary supplies, fuel, and resources, something that the US has in large supply. A negotiation is possible, but it remains unseen how the local tribal warlords will interact with and effect their new 'partner'.
<br/>
<br/>2. Enemy Forces
<br/>
<br/>a. Composition:
<br/>
<br/>Light infantry equipped with varied modern weaponry with several light armed vehicles. I have seen a large variety of calibers and weapons being used.
<br/>
<br/>b. Disposition:
<br/>
<br/>We're located in and around the <marker name='opfor_start'>Al-Qaeda Outpost</marker> area with high mobility.
<br/>
<br/>c. Strength:
<br/>
<br/>Platoon sized.
<br/>
<br/>3. Neutral Forces
<br/>
<br/>a. Composition:
<br/>
<br/>Multiple local tribal warlords with men and spies are located throughout the area. They will most likely have valuable information about the enemy force, so they will be necessary in gaining the upper hand in any fight, although their information won't come without a price.
<br/>Light UN infantry are stationed at the Neutral Zone to maintain peace and the safety of the area's inhabitants.
<br/>
<br/>b. Disposition:
<br/>
<br/>The local tribal warlords are based near <marker name='ind_start_1'>Azagal</marker> and <marker name='ind_start_2'>Razzale</marker>, respectively, while the UN are based out of <marker name='tottah_patrol_center'>Tottah</marker>. I only expect the warlords to displace from their base of operations.
<br/>
<br/>c. Strength:
<br/>
<br/>I've only heard about 2 squads of lightly armed tribal men and a platoon of standard armed UN peacekeepers.
<br/>
<br/>4. Friendly Forces
<br/>
<br/>a. Higher Units Mission:
<br/>
<br/>Live.
<br/>
<br/>b. Composition:
<br/>
<br/>Me and my friend, and whoever else is still alive out there.
