<br/>1. Background
<br/>
<br/>The local Al-Qaeda forces recently disabled a low-flying US Army Blackhawk and took the pilots captive, leaving the surrounding US forces no choice but to send in a small force to intervene. The local Al-Qaeda, though, have been looking to leave the once prosperous land of FATA but lack the necessary supplies, fuel, and resources, something that the US has in large supply. A negotiation is possible, although the objectives for each side are clear, and it remains unseen how the local tribal warlords will interact with and effect their new 'partners'.
