<br/>1. Mission-Specific Notes
<br/>
<br/>a. End Conditions
<br/>
<br/> - Either Blufor or Opfor successfully extracts.
<br/> - Either Blufor or Opfor sustains 80% or more casualties.
<br/> - The time limit of " + str(round(PARAMS_TimeLimit / 60)) + " minutes is reached.
<br/>
<br/>b. Medical Notes
<br/>
<br/>Uses ACE Wounds and Medical. All units may use Bandages / Morphine / Epinephrine. Only medics may use Medkits.
<br/>This is a no-respawn mission. All casualties will immediately go to spectator.
<br/>
<br/>c. Gameplay Notes
<br/>
<br/> - This is an open-ended mission, so anything can be done. All sides work by an economy of incentive, so the only rule is to do what is in the best interest for your team.
<br/> - If anyone fires a weapon in the Neutral Zone, or if anyone is killed by another in the Neutral Zone, all UN Soldiers will attack the firer/killer.
<br/> - It is intended that a barter system be established between the Warlords and Blufor/Opfor (trading information for weapons, equipment, and vehicles).
<br/> - To retrieve extraction information from the Enemy's CO, you can either ask for it (take their word) or go up to the Enemy's CO, interact on him/her, and take the extraction information (this will only make the extract marker appear on the map of the person who interacted with the CO). Multiple people may do this.
