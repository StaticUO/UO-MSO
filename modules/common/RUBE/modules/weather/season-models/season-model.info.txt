The season model needs a distinct name (I suggest you use the name of a city), which will act as the identifier for that model and also the filename has to match this identifier.

Second you need to activate new models in /RUBE/modules/weather/season.sqf by adding your model to the listing of valid models (_models).

A season model is a function that returns seasonal data (array) defined as follows:

[
   // 0: temperature
   [ 
      [
         0: Tmin (or average) in degree celsius,         (scalar in [-oo, oo])
         1: standard deviation (on Tmin),                (scalar in [0, oo])
         2: Trange (daily),                              (scalar in [0, oo])
            s.t. Tmin + Trange = Tmax
      ],
      ...
   ],
   
   // 1: precipitation
   [
      [
         0: probability: daysWithPrecipitation/31        (scalar in [0,1]), 
         1: avg. intensity                               (scalar in [0,1])
      ],
      ...
   ],
   
   // 2: fog
   [
      [
         0: probability: daysWith(noteworthy)Fog/31      (scalar in [0,1])
      ],
      ...
   ],
   
   // 3: wind
   [
      [
         0: avg. wind speed in m/s                       (scalar in [0,oo])
      ]
   ]
