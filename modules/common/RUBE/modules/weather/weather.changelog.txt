   ### First published iteration.


2012-02-20:

   ### Weather Engine: Tmin and Trange were fixed throughout the day, 
       based on todays data only, creating noticeable uncontinuity at
       24:00 -> 00:01. 
       
       Now they will be interpolated (as has been originally planned),
       s.t. todays temperature data will be linearly mixed with either 
       the previous or the next days data:

        previous   :     50% ---->
        todays data:     50% ----> 100% ----> 50% 
        next       :                    ----> 50% 
             
             12:00 ---> 24:00 ---> 12:00 ---> 24:00 ---> 12:00
                                  (today)  (advance to
                                             next day)
       
       thus we'll end up with continuous temperatures, while advancing
       to the next days data.
       
       BTW: This is the reason why Tmin and Trange are _not_ based on
            random walkers/oscillators. (components that are based on
            them transition seamlessly thanks to the engine's cycles,
            while the temperature gets calculated by a function based 
            on daytime)
            
       Note that there is still a small jump in temperature at 24:00 -> 
       00:01 since the function modeling the diurnal cycle (Pearson 
       Type-III distribution) isn't exactly continuous. This jump is 
       negligible however (usually below one degree celsius).
       
       - Forecast report calculation has been adapted accordingly.

   ### Weather Engine: faster removal of particle-effects without
       intensity. (once dropped to zero/below threshold, particle
       sources were only removed at the end of a full cycle. They're
       removed within a subcycle now; _getCycleDelay ~= 10-20 sec.)

   ### Weather Engine Interface: new constant 
       'enable-auto-advance-forecast', which was only accessible from 
       within the running weather engine's state machine.
       
   ### Weather Engine Interface: new command 'hard-reset-weather-engine'
       to reset without smooth transition/full cycle to the new forecast 
       data.

   ### Forecast Report: new function 'RUBE_weatherCreateForecast' to 
       calculate the data for a forecast report. 
       
       The forecast report is now decoupled from the weather/forecast 
       data and nomore calculated on the fly, s.t. there can co-exist as 
       many forecast reports as you like. This, for example, allows to 
       still have the "journal" from yesterday around, while you send 
       Hans to get todays "journal" with a newer/up-to-date forecast 
       report...
   
   ### Forecast Report: revised script 'fn_weatherReport.sqf' which
       enables/attaches forecast reports on objects ships with 
       required/optional tagged parameters now.
       
   ### Weather Engine Demo Script/Mission: 
   
        - runs now whether the weather module has been placed onto the 
          map or not. (though I still don't recommend this, since we
          need to hard-reset the weather engine, which might be a bit 
          wierd right at the start of the mission, but whatever...)
          
        - demonstrates  different co-existing forecast reports. (they all 
          get updated after a new day has begun, s.t. the last n forecast
          reports are beeing kept; oh and there's no notable delay anymore 
          for the reports to update, since we advance the forecast manually 
          by script now, instead of waiting for the engine/fsm to auto 
          advance...)
          
          - note that the demo skips n days right at the beginning of the 
            mission to create n old forecast reports for the "journals".
        
        - radio call added to manually hard reset the engine (to be used
          after time has been skipped for example; otherwise the engine
          needs a full cycle (overcast and fog) to transition to the new
          data.
     
       
2012-03-27:
 
   ### Season Model: added failsafe model (prague) as default for unknown 
       worlds.
   
   ### Fixed script-version
       
   ### Season Model: three new season models added:
   
       - model: arauca (Columbia)
         class: Tropical rainforest climate (Af)
       
       - model: kano (Nigeria)
         class: Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Aw)
         
       - model: oulu (Finland)
         class: Continental Subarctic or Boreal (taiga) climates 
                (Dfc, Dwc, Dsc)
         
       I hope that suits you well enough for now Sir _William. :)  
       
       ...and defaults have been set for some of the community 
       made islands:
       
         - lingor    -> arauca
         - isladuala -> kano
         - tropica   -> kano
         - thirsk/w  -> oulu
         - namalsk   -> prague
         - sbrodj    -> prague
         - fallujah  -> kandahar
