no, BS doesn't stand for bullshit, it stands for building site. 
                                                ---------------

In this version of CoIn, we do not directly place down stuff with the CoIn interface. Instead we merely place down building sites (for the choosen building).
To advance these constructions, you (or the AI) need to grab some supplies (physically; in the form of ingame-objects) and build that stuff. In consequence, you can place down as many building sites as you like, if you're out of (physical) supplies, you can't finish them anyway...

Or something like this. At least that's the plan. 
We'll see how this turns out later... /:
